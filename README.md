# Image Viewer

A simple image viewer that lets you collect and organize image links from
around the web.

## Controls

Use `ctrl-m` to bring up the image-management window.

In it, create an album and start adding images. It's as simple as that.

Use the `arrowkeys` to navigate back and forth between images.

Use the `mousewheel` to zoom in and out and `click-and-drag` to pan.

If you want to clear all your data, use `ctrl-c`.

When viewing a video, press and hold `v` to enable the mouse to interact with
the video window.
